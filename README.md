# **US BIKESHARE DATA EXPLORATION WITH PYTHON**

## Description

**Project Overview**


>In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.



**An Interactive Experience**



The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:

* 	Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?

* 	Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?

* 	(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?

* 	(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?


# Needed Software Applications:

To complete this project, the following software were used:

* 	Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda

* 	A text editor Atom.

* 	A terminal application (Cygwin on Windows)
